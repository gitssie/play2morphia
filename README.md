play2morphia
============

Trying out play framework 2 while using morphia for mapping Java objects to/from mongodb, this will be an hobby project 
where I am trying out different things with mongodb (via morphia). There will be none or very few examples 
of using mongodb "as a user from views" instead, things will be tried out with unit testing at backend level.

Hopefully at the end of this journey I master combo of morphia/mongodb much better than now, and this project lives on as 
good resource to others wanting to achieve the same.

When to use MongoDB, why not MySQL ?
